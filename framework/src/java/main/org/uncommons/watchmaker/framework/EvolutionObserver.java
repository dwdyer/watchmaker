/**
 * <p>Call-back interface so that programs can monitor the state of a long-running evolutionary
 * algorithm.</p> <p>Depending on the parameters of the evolutionary program, an observer may be
 * invoked dozens or hundreds of times a second, especially when the population size is small as this
 * leads to shorter generations. The processing performed by an evolution observer should be
 * reasonably short-lived so as to avoid slowing down the evolution.</p> <p><strong>Using an
 * EvolutionObserver to update a Swing GUI:</strong> Evolution updates are dispatched on the request
 * thread. To adhere to Swing threading rules you must use {@link javax.swing.SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)}
 * or {@link javax.swing.SwingUtilities#invokeAndWait(Runnable)} to perform any updates to Swing
 * components.</p> <p>Be aware that if there are too many Swing updates queued for asynchronous
 * execution with {@link javax.swing.SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)}, due to a high number of
 * generations per second, then the GUI will become sluggish and unresponsive. This situation can be
 * mitigated by minimising the amount of work done by the evolution observer and/or by not updating
 * the GUI every time the observer is notified.</p> <p>The unresponsive GUI problem does not occur
 * when using
 * {@link javax.swing.SwingUtilities#invokeAndWait(Runnable)} because updates are executed
 * synchronously. The downside is that evolution threads are stalled/idle until Swing has finished
 * performing the updates. This won't make much difference on a single core machine but will impact
 * throughput on multi-core machines.</p>
 * <p/>
 * @param <T> The type of entity that exists in the evolving population that is being observed. This
 * type can be bound to a super-type of the actual population type so as to allow a non-specific
 * observer that can be re-used for different population types.
