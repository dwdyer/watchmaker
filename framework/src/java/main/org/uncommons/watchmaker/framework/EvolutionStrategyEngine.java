     * the population at each generation.
     * @param fitnessEvaluator A function for assigning fitness scores to candidate
     * solutions.
     * @param plusSelection If true this object implements a (μ+λ) evolution strategy rather
     * than (μ,λ).  With plus-selection the parents are eligible for survival.  With
     * comma-selection only the offspring survive.
     * @param offspringMultiplier How many offspring to create for each member of the parent
     * population.  This parameter effectively defines a multiplier for μ that gives λ.
     * We define λ in this indirect way because we don't know the value of μ until
     * it is passed as an argument to one of the evolve methods. 
     * For a 1+1 ES this parameter would be set to one.  For other evolution strategies
     * a higher value might be better. Eiben & Smith suggest 7 as a good value. 
     * @param rng The source of randomness used by all stochastic processes (including
     * evolutionary operators and selection strategies).
