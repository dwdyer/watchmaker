    /**
     * Create a steady-state evolution strategy in which one or more (usually just one) evolved
     * offspring replace randomly-chosen individuals.
     * @param candidateFactory Factory used to create the initial population that is
     * iteratively evolved.
     * @param evolutionScheme The evolutionary operator that modifies the population.  The
     * number of candidates used as input is controlled by the {@code selectionSize} parameter.
     * The number of candidates that will be outputted depends on the implementation.  Typically
     * it will be the same as the input size, but this is not necessary.  In fact, for steady-state
     * evolution, it is typical that the output size is always 1, regardless of the input size, so
     * that only one member of the population is replaced at a time.  To acheive this using cross-over
     * requires a cross-over implementation that returns only one offspring, rather than the normal
     * two.
     * @param fitnessEvaluator The fitness function.
     * @param selectionStrategy The strategy for selecting which candidate(s) will be
     * the parent(s) when evolving individuals.
     * @param selectionSize How many parent candidates are required by the evolution scheme.
     * This controls how many individuals will be provided to the evolutionary operator at
     * each iteration. If you are just using mutation, this will typically be 1.  For
     * cross-over, two separate parents are required, so this must be set to 2.
     * @param forceSingleCandidateUpdate Some evolutionary operators, specifically cross-over
     * operators, generate more than one evolved individual.  A true steady-state algorithm will
     * only replace one individual at a time.  Setting this parameter to true forces the evolution
     * to discard any additional generated offspring so that for each iteration of the algorithm
     * there is only one updated individual.  This allows cross-over operators that were designed
     * for generational evolutionary algorithms to be reused for steady-state evolution.  A more
     * efficient, but less straightforward, alternative would be to implement a steady-state-specific
     * cross-over operator that returns only a single evolved individual.  Setting this parameter to
     * false permits multiple candidates to be replaced per iteration, depending on the specifics of
     * the evolutionary operator(s).
     * @param rng The source of randomness used by all stochastic processes (including
     * evolutionary operators and selection strategies).
