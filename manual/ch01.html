    Software is normally developed in a very precise, deterministic way.  The behaviour of a
    computer is governed by strict logical rules.  A computer invariably does exactly what
    it is told to do.
  </p><p>
    When writing a program to solve a particular problem, software developers will identify
    the necessary sub-tasks that the program must perform.  Algorithms are chosen and
    implemented for each task.  The completed program becomes a detailed specification of
    exactly how to get from A to B.  Every aspect is carefully designed by its developers
    who must understand how the various components interact to deliver the program's
    functionality.
  </p><p>
    This prescriptive approach to solving problems with computers has served us well and is
    responsible for most of the software applications that we use today.  However, it is not
    without limitations.
    Solutions to problems are constrained by the intuition, knowledge and prejudices
    of those who develop the software.
    <span class="emphasis"><em>The programmers have to know exactly how to solve the problem.</em></span>
  </p><p>
    Another characteristic of the prescriptive approach that is sometimes problematic is
    that it is best suited to finding exact answers.  Not all problems have exact solutions,
    and some that do may be too computationally expensive to solve.  Sometimes it is
    more useful to be able to find an approximate answer quickly than to waste time searching
    for a better solution.

      Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are inspired by the biological model of evolution and
      natural selection first proposed by Charles Darwin in 1859.
      In the natural world, evolution helps species adapt to their environments.
      Environmental factors that influence the survival prospects of an organism
      include climate, availability of food and the dangers of predators.
    </p><span xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="d0e73" class="indexterm"/><p>
      Species change over the course of many generations.
      Mutations occur randomly.  Some mutations will be advantageous, but many will be
      useless or detrimental.  Progress comes from the feedback provided by non-random
      natural selection.
      For example, organisms that can survive for long periods without water will be
      more likely to thrive in dry conditions than those that can't.
      Likewise, animals that can run fast will be more successful at evading predators
      than their slower rivals.
      If a random genetic modification helps an organism to survive and to reproduce,
      that modification will itself survive and spread throughout the population, via
      the organism's offspring.
    </p><p>
      Evolutionary algorithms are based on a simplified model of this biological evolution.
      To solve a particular problem we create an environment in which potential
      solutions can evolve.  The environment is shaped by the parameters of the problem
      and encourages the evolution of good solutions.
    </p><span xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="d0e80" class="indexterm"/><p>
      The field of Evolutionary Computation encompasses several types of evolutionary
      algorithm.  These include <span class="emphasis"><em>Genetic Algorithms</em></span> (GAs),
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Evolution Strategies</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Genetic Programming</em></span>
      (GP), <span class="emphasis"><em>Evolutionary Programming</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Learning
      Classifier Systems</em></span>.
    </p><span xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="d0e100" class="indexterm"/><p>
      The most common type of evolutionary algorithm is the generational genetic
      algorithm.  We'll cover other EA variants in later chapters but, for now,
      all of the evolutionary algorithms that we meet will be some kind of generational
      GA.
    </p><span xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="d0e105" class="indexterm"/><span xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="d0e108" class="indexterm"/><p>
      The basic outline of a generational GA is as follows (most other EA variants are
      broadly similar).
      A <span class="emphasis"><em>population</em></span> of candidate solutions is iteratively evolved
      over many <span class="emphasis"><em>generations</em></span>.  Mimicking the concept of
      natural selection in biology, the survival of candidates (or their offspring)
      from generation to generation in an EA is governed by a <span class="emphasis"><em>fitness
      function</em></span> that evaluates each candidate according to how close it is to
      the desired outcome, and a <span class="emphasis"><em>selection strategy</em></span> that favours
      the better solutions.
      Over time, the quality of the solutions in the population should improve.
      If the program is successful, we can terminate the evolution once it has found
      a solution that is good enough.
    </p><div class="section" title="An Example"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="d0e125">An Example</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Now that we have introduced the basic concepts and terminology, I will attempt
        to illustrate by way of an example. Suppose that we want to use evolution to generate
        a particular character string, for example "HELLO WORLD".  This is a contrived example
        in as much as it assumes that we don't know how to create such a string and that
        evolution is the best approach available to us.  However, bear with me as this simple
        example is useful for demonstrating exactly how the evolutionary approach works.
      </p><p>
        Each candidate solution in our population will be a string.  We'll use a fixed-length
        representation so that each string is 11 characters long.  Each character in a string
        will be one of the 27 valid characters (the upper case letters 'A' to 'Z' plus the space
        character).
      </p><p>
        For the fitness function we'll use the simple approach of assigning a candidate
        solution one point for each position in the string that has the correct character.
        For the string "HELLO WORLD" this gives a maximum possible fitness score of 11 (the
        length of the string).
      </p><p>
        The first task for the evolutionary algorithm is to randomly generate the initial
        population. We can use any size population that we choose.
        Typical EA population sizes can vary from tens to thousands of individuals.
        For this example we will use a population size of 10.
        After the initialisation of the population we might have the following candidates
        (fitness scores in brackets):
        </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
  1.  GERZUNFXCEN  (1)
  2.  HSFDAHDMUYZ  (1)
  3.  UQ IGARHGJN  (0)
  4.  ZASIB WSUVP  (2)
  5.  XIXROIUAZBH  (1)
  6.  VDLGCWMBFYA  (1)
  7.  SY YUHYRSEE  (0)
  8.  EUSVBIVFHFK  (0)
  9.  HHENRFZAMZH  (1)
  10. UJBBDFZPLCN  (0)
          </pre></div><p>
      </p><p>
        None of these candidate solutions is particularly good. The best (number 4) has just two
        characters out of eleven that match the target string (the space character and the 'W').
      </p><p>
        The next step is to select candidates based on their fitness and use them to create
        a new generation.  One technique for favouring the selection of fitter candidates over
        weaker candidates is to assign each candidate a selection probability proportionate to
        its fitness.
      </p><span xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="d0e144" class="indexterm"/><span xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="d0e147" class="indexterm"/><p>
        If we use <span class="emphasis"><em>fitness-proportionate selection</em></span>, none of the candidates
        with zero fitness will be selected and the candidate with a fitness of 2 is twice as likely
        to be selected as any of the candidates with a fitness of 1. For the next step we need to
        select 10 parents, so it is obvious that some of the fit candidates are going to be selected
        multiple times.
      </p><span xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="d0e157" class="indexterm"/><p>
        Now that we have some parents, we can breed the next generation.  We do this via a process
        called <span class="emphasis"><em>cross-over</em></span>, which is analogous to sexual reproduction in biology.
        For each pair of parents, a cross-over point is selected randomly.  Assuming that the first
        two randomly selected parents are numbers 2 and 4, if the cross-over occurs after the
        first four characters, we will get the following offspring:
        </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
  Parent 1:     <span class="bold"><strong>HSFDAHDMUYZ</strong></span>
  Parent 2:     ZASIB WSUVP

  Offspring 1:  <span class="bold"><strong>HSFD</strong></span>B WSUVP
  Offspring 2:  ZASI<span class="bold"><strong>AHDMUYZ</strong></span>
          </pre></div><p>
      </p><span xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="d0e178" class="indexterm"/><p>
        This recombination has given us two new candidates for the next generation, one of which is
        better than either of the parents (offspring 1 has a fitness score of 3).  This shows how
        cross-over can lead towards better solutions.  However, looking at the initial population as
        a whole, we can see that no combination of cross-overs will ever result in a candidate with
        a fitness higher than 6.  This is because, among all 10 original candidates, there are only 6
        positions in which we have the correct character.  This can be mitigated to some extent by
        increasing the size of the population.  With 100 individuals in the initial population we
        would be much more likely to have the necessary building blocks for a perfect solution, but
        there is no guarantee.  This is where <span class="emphasis"><em>mutation</em></span> comes in.
      </p><p>
        Mutation is implemented by modifying each character in a string according to some small
        probability, say 0.02 or 0.05.  This means that any single individual will be changed only
        slightly by mutation, or perhaps not at all.
      </p><p>
        By applying mutation to each of the offspring produced by cross-over we will occasionally
        introduce correct characters in new positions.  We will also occasionally remove correct
        characters but these bad mutations are unlikely to survive selection in the next generation,
        so this is not a big problem.  Advantageous mutations will be propagated by cross-over and
        selection and will quickly spread throughout the population.
      </p><p>
        After repeating this process for dozens or perhaps even hundreds of generations we will
        eventually converge on our desired solution.
      </p><p>
        This is a convoluted process for finding a string that we already knew to start with.
        However, as we shall see in the remainder of this book, the evolutionary approach
        generalises to deal with problems where we don't know what the best solution is and
        therefore can't encode that knowledge in our fitness function.
      </p><p>
        The important point demonstrated by this example is that we can arrive at a satisfactory
        solution without having to enumerate every possible candidate in the search space.
        Even for this trivial example, a brute force search would involve generating and
        checking approximately 5.6 quadrillion strings.

            Generate a new population of offspring by randomly altering and/or combining

            cross-over and mutation.
            Cross-over takes two parents, cuts them each into two or more pieces and recombines
            the pieces to create two new offspring.  Mutation copies an individual but with
