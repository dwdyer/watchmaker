/**
 * <p>A wrapper that provides caching for {@link FitnessEvaluator} implementations. The results of
 * fitness evaluations are stored in a cache so that if the same candidate is evaluated twice, the
 * expense of the fitness calculation can be avoided the second time. The cache uses weak references
 * in order to avoid memory leakage.</p>
 * <p/> <p>Caching of fitness values can be a useful optimisation in situations where the fitness
 * evaluation is expensive and there is a possibility that some candidates will survive from
 * generation to generation unmodified. Programs that use elitism are one example of candidates
 * surviving unmodified. Another scenario is when the configured evolutionary operator does not
 * always modify every candidate in the population for every generation.</p>
 * <p/> <p>Unmodified candidates are identified by reference equality. This is a valid assumption
 * since evolutionary operators are required to return distinct objects, except when the candidate is
 * unaffected by the evolution, as per the contract of the
 * {@link EvolutionaryOperator} interface. In other words, the Watchmaker Framework treats candidate
 * representations as immutable even when that is not strictly the case.</p>
 * <p/> <p>Caching of fitness scores is provided as an option rather than as the default Watchmaker
 * Framework behaviour because caching is only valid when fitness evaluations are <em>isolated</em>
 * and repeatable. An isolated fitness evaluation is one where the result depends only upon the
 * candidate being evaluated. This is not the case when candidates are evaluated against the other
 * members of the population. So unless the fitness evaluator ignores the second parameter to the
 * {@link #getFitness(Object, List)} method, caching must not be used.</p>
 * <p/>
 * @param <T> The type of evolvable entity that can be evaluated.
