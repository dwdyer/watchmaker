 * score. This is analogous to each candidate being assigned an area on a roulette wheel
 * proportionate to its fitness and the wheel being spun <n>i</n> times. Candidates may be selected
 * more than once.</p>
 * <p/> <p>In some instances, particularly with small population sizes, the randomness of selection
 * may result in excessively high occurrences of particular candidates. If this is a problem, {@link StochasticUniversalSampling}
 * provides an alternative fitness-proportionate strategy for selection.</p>
